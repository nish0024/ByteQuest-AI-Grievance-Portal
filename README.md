## Project Overview
Public governance bodies receive thousands of citizen grievances every day related to roads, water supply, sanitation, healthcare, electricity, and other civic issues. These grievances are usually submitted as unstructured text and are manually reviewed, which leads to delays, poor prioritization, and lack of transparency.

Smart Grievance AI is an intelligent grievance redressal system that automatically analyzes grievance text, identifies the relevant government department, and assigns priority levels based on urgency. This helps authorities resolve critical complaints faster and improves overall citizen satisfaction.

## System Architecture
The system consists of a citizen-facing complaint submission interface, a backend service that processes and analyzes grievance text using rule-based NLP logic, and an admin dashboard that displays categorized grievances with assigned departments and priority levels.
