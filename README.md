## Project Overview
Public governance bodies receive thousands of citizen grievances every day related to roads, water supply, sanitation, healthcare, electricity, and other civic issues. These grievances are usually submitted as unstructured text and are manually reviewed, which leads to delays, poor prioritization, and lack of transparency.

Smart Grievance AI is an intelligent grievance redressal system powered by **Google Gemini AI** that automatically analyzes grievance text, intelligently classifies complaints into relevant categories, assigns priority levels based on urgency, and generates concise summaries. This helps authorities resolve critical complaints faster and improves overall citizen satisfaction.

## System Architecture
The system follows a modern full-stack architecture:

1. **Citizen Portal** - A React-based responsive web interface for citizens to submit grievances with a multi-step form (personal details, grievance details, document upload)
2. **Backend API** - An Express.js server that handles grievance submission, AI processing, and data management
3. **AI Processing Layer** - Google Gemini Flash API integration for intelligent grievance analysis, categorization, priority detection, and summarization
4. **Database** - MongoDB Atlas for persistent storage of grievances and tracking
5. **Tracking System** - Real-time grievance status tracking using unique tracking IDs
