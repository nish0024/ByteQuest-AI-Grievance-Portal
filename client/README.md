🚀 ByteQuest Hackathon 2026: AI-Powered Grievance Portal
Team Name: The Sirens

Team Lead: Nishtha Lalwani

Team Members: Srijan Sharma, Ruhani Grover

🌟 Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive MERN-stack solution for modern governance, developed in under 24 hours during the ByteQuest Hackathon. The platform bridges the gap between citizens and municipal authorities by using Google Gemini AI to automate the triage of public grievances.

Key Technical Achievements
AI-Automated Summarization: Integrated the Gemini Flash API to process raw citizen descriptions and generate concise, 1-sentence action items for administrators (e.g., transforming a long complaint into: "Power instability impacting student productivity").

Full-Stack Synchronization: Resolved critical connectivity and CORS issues by re-engineering the backend infrastructure to run on a unified Port 5000 system.

Robust Error Handling: Debugged high-priority UI crashes and mapping logic, ensuring a stable "Live Demo" state even under heavy data loads.

Complete Citizen-to-Admin Lifecycle: Built a seamless flow including a dynamic Landing Page, an AI-validated Grievance Form, real-time Status Tracking, and an Admin Dashboard.

🛠️ The Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js, Vite, Tailwind CSS

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Database: MongoDB Atlas (Cloud)

AI Layer: Google Generative AI (Gemini Flash API)

📊 Technical Challenges Resolved
As the Team Lead, I navigated several "critical path" technical challenges to ensure project delivery:

Interface Stability: Resolved a broken dashboard caused by undefined styles and mapping logic before the final deadline.

Infrastructure Migration: Unified the client-server communication architecture to eliminate connectivity blocks and internal server errors.

Data Integrity: Implemented a custom seed script to ensure the dashboard showcased realistic, high-priority municipal cases for the final evaluation.
